1. Introduction
This is a program which simulates CT scan tomography, using linear algebra, which optimized using Xiaolin Wu's line-drawing algorithm.

2. How to use
- Run mainprog.m
- select line to be sliced on top right image, using vertical scroll.
- click "rekonstruksi" (Reconstruct).
- click "lanjut" (continue) to continue, or "henti" (stop) to stop.

3. UI
Top-Right: a series of pre-scanned images of selected item (geraham--molar). Horizontal scroll to view different angle, Vertical scroll to select sliced surface, represented by line.
Bottom-Left: A sinogram for the selected surface. Sinogram is the X-ray image of the surface line (top right) along different angles.
Bottom-Right: A reconstructed CT scan of sliced surface.
